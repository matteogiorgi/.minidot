## Install/Uninstall

Just run `setup.sh`/`restore.sh` scripts. The setup will backup any of your old configs, install all the packages needed and symlink the *Minidot* files correctly; while the restore script will rollback all the changes and reinstate your previously saved config files.




### Linux system container manager

In case you do not want to mess around with your current configuration or just feel the need to containerize your work environment, you can install *Minidot* inside a container: [LXD](https://ubuntu.com/lxd) is an excellent solution. Take a look at its [first&#x2011;steps](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/latest/tutorial/first_steps/#first-steps) page, it's very easy to follow and will get you up and running in no time.




## Nerd Fonts

If you need to use a font with glyphs, you can install one of the Nerd Fonts available:

1. download a [Nerd&nbsp;Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
2. unzip and copy it inside `~/.fonts` or `~/.local/share/fonts`
3. run the command `fc-cache -fv` to manually rebuild the font cache
