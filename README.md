# .MINIDOT IS NO LONGER MANTEINED

This repo is obsolite and no longer in use: I have decided to split my work environment into three.
Take a look at my *Personal Debian Environment*:
- [pde-base](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/pde-base)
- [pde-plug](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/pde-plug)
- [pde-tile](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/pde-tile)

### A portable Debian environment
This repo contains a streamlined configuration of GNU/Linux dotfiles, designed to work with any Debian based distribution. Run [`setup.sh`](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/.minidot/blob/master/setup.sh) to backup any of your old configs, install the dependencies and symlink all the files correctly; the [`restore.sh`](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/.minidot/blob/master/restore.sh) script will rollback all the changes and reinstate your previously saved config files.
