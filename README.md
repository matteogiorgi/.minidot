# The ultimate dotfiles

This repo contains a streamlined configuration of GNU/Linux dotfiles, designed to work with any [Debian](https://www.debian.org) based distribution. Run `setup.sh` to backup any of your old configs, install the dependencies and symlink all the files correctly; the `restore.sh` script will rollback all the changes and reinstate your previously saved config files.
