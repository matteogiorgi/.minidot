# A super-portable Gnu/Linux setup

This repo contains a micro (and very portable) configuration of my *dotfiles* derived from [.udot](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/.udot). They are meant to be used alongside a vanilla install of [Debian](https://www.debian.org/download) or [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/#download). The scripts are in good order and well readable but there wont be no more than the bare essentials.
