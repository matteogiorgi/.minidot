# Mini-Linux environment

This repo contains a streamlined configuration of my dotfiles, and it is designed to work with any distribution based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/download)/[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/#download) or within a Linux subsystem, such as [Microsoft WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or [ChromeOS LDE](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en).

Minidot offers a ready-to-use, batteries-included work environment but if you need [more gear](https://apps.gnome.org/), you can always use `apt`/[`snap`](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd)/[`brew`](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) or download any deb package and install it via `dpkg`.
