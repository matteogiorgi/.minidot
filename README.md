# The ultimate dotfiles

This repo contains a streamlined configuration of GNU/Linux dotfiles, designed to work with any [Debian](https://www.debian.org) based distribution.

- <u>`setup.sh`</u> will backup any of your old configs, install the dependencies and symlink all the files correctly
- <u>`restore.sh`</u> will rollback all the changes and reinstate your previously saved config files
