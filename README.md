# The ultimate dotfiles

This repo contains a streamlined configuration of working Linux dotfiles, designed to work with any [Debian](https://www.debian.org) distro. Run `setup.sh` to backup any of your old configs, install the dependencies and symlink all the files correctly; the `restore.sh` script will rollback all the changes and reinstate your previously saved config files.

Apps not included but quite useful are: [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode#readme) and [Input&#x2011;Remapper](https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper#readme).
