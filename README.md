# A very effective GNU/Linux config

This repo contains a minimal configuration of my *dotfiles*, I keep them organized using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) and they are meant to be used alongside a vanilla install of [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/#download). The scripts are in good order and well readable but there wont be no more than the bare essentials.




## Packages

```
bash bash-completion tmux vim git curl wget stow htop trash-cli
xclip xdo xdotool fonts-firacode wamerican witalian
```
