# This script resets VSCode setting using VSpaceCode extensions pack:
#   noflag          -> resets VSCode only
#   --zero          -> removes all VSCode configurations (rm -rf ~/.config/Code/User)
#   --insiders      -> resets VSCode Insiders instead of VSCode
#   --zero-insiders -> removes all VSCode Insiders configurations (rm -rf ~/.config/Code\ -\ Insiders/User)
#
# Here the full set of extensions installed by this script (for more information visit https://vspacecode.github.io/):
# VSpaceCode, Which Key, Vim, fuzzy-search, File Browser, edamagit, Monokai Pro.
